# A REQUEST From us to you
# ========================
#
# It took a lot of work to put this database together and it takes even more to
# maintain it. For this, we do not charge you anything. We would **really**
# appreciate a link from your site back to us.
#
# It won't make you famous but it will earn you our gratitude :)

# History
# =======
#
# The IPV4 database was first implemented in 2005 to offer a free alternative to
# the commercial databases that were available at the time. Today, there are
# literally hundreds of sources of "IP-to-Country" databases available. Many
# based on the data from this database.
#
# When we started this database we were amazed to find that almost 2 billion
# IP addresses in the IPV4 space had been assigned. Today, that figure is just
# over 3.5 billion. The database has grown from about 2MB unzipped
# to over 6MB. That's a lot of new assigned IP space for just a few years!
#
# In July 2010 an experimental version of the IPV6 database was released. It is
# available an two flavors -
#
# A database of IPV6 ranges
# A database in IPV6 CIDR format
#
# What this database is
# =====================
#
# This Database is operated and maintained by Webnet77 and updated every 24
# hours. It represents most of the IPV4 and IPV6 numbers in use on the Internet
# today and includes the IANA reserved IPs.
#
# This Database is automatically reconstituted every 24 hours by special
# software running on our servers. The top of the main page shows how long ago
# it was updated.
#
# Database download limit
# =======================
#
# We do limit downloads and lookups per IP per 8 hour period.
#
# We use a system of "htpoints":
#
# a. You are allowed 150 hitpoints in any 8 hour period.
# b. An IP lookup costs 1 hitpoint(s).
# c. A complete Database download is 18 hitpoints
# d. If you exceed 150 hitpoints in any 8 hour period, you will not
#    be able to download or lookup anything until the full 8 hour period
#    has elapsed.
# e. Should you attempt further downloads while "banned", a weighting algorithm will
#    be applied to your IP address causing further time extensions.
# f. If you reach more than 900 hitpoints in 8 hours, your IP will be
#    banned for a v-e-r-y long time.
#
# PLEASE DO NOT ask us to remove your IP manually if you get banned. It's your job
# as a developer to make sure your IP does not get banned. Your IP will
# automatically be removed eventually depending on the above criteria.
#
# Unfortunately we have to do this as some "developers" have abused our resources
# in the past because their software went haywire and tried to download the
# database hundreds of times per minute essentially resulting in a denial of
# Service attack.
#
# For some this is a problem as certain ISP's proxy outbound users on a single IP
# and your download gets accumulated with others on the same IP. We would love to
# help but unfortunately there is nothing we can do about that.
#
# A Request regarding automatic downloads
# =======================================
#
# If you are downloading automatically with a CRON job, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT
# set your download time to 00:00:00 (midnight). Please use some arbitrary time
# that is not 12 midnight. If everyone downloaded at exactly midnight, the
# download speed for all would slow to a crawl. Bottom line is to get the
# best speed, DO NOT download at midnight. Please choose an arbitrary
# time (especially the minutes).
#
# AUTOMATIC DOWNLOADS
# ===================
#
# To do an automated download with something like wget, use the following link
# format (some versions of wget may require you add the http:// prefix):
#
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=1 -O /path/IpToCountry.csv.gz      IPV4 gzip
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=2 -O /path/IpToCountry.csv.zip     IPV4 zip
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=3 -O /path/IpToCountry.csv.MD5     IPV4 MD5 (CSV file)
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=4 -O /path/IpToCountry.dat         IPV4 Geo::IPfree
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=5 -O /path/IpToCountry.dat.MD5     IPV4 MD5 Geo::IPfree
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=6 -O /path/country-codes.txt       Country Codes
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=7 -O /path/IpToCountry.6R.csv.gz   IPV6 Ranges
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=8 -O /path/IpToCountry.6R.csv.MD5  IPV6 Ranges MD5
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=9 -O /path/IpToCountry.6C.csv.gz   IPV6 CIDR
# wget software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=10 -O /path/IpToCountry.6C.csv.MD5 IPV6 CIDR MD5

# IP FROM & : Numerical representation of IP address.

#             1.2.3.4 = 4 + (3 * 256) + (2 * 256 * 256) + (1 * 256 * 256 * 256)

#             Also included as of April 22, 2005 are the IANA IETF Reserved
#             address numbers. These are important since any source claiming
#             to be from one of these IPs must be spoofed.
#
# ASSIGNED  : The date this IP or block was assigned. (In Epoch seconds)
#             NOTE: Where the allocation or assignment has been transferred from
#                   one registry to another, the date represents the date of first
#                   assignment or allocation as received in from the original RIR.
#                   It is noted that where records do not show a date of first
#                   assignment, the date is given as "0".

# UPDATE LOG
# ==========
#
# June 2005    - Countries falling under AFRINIC now show correctly
#
# October 2006 - Many thanks to Lee Cjin Pheow from Singapore for this:
#                As of September 2006, Serbia and Montenegro now have new ISO
#                Country codes. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia and
#                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro.
#
#                We have updated the database to include "RS" and "ME" for these
#                two contries but currently the registries still provide the OLD
#                country code data. Thus you may need to translate the codes
#                "YU" and "CS" -> "ME" and the same for "ME".
#
#                For the most part it appears that translating CS -> RS and
#                YU -> ME works but it is probably not entirely accurate.
#
# Nov 2006     - Added country code for ÅLAND ISLANDS - AX - ALA
# Mar 2007     - Added Country code for JERSEY - JE - JEY
# Mar 2007     - Added ASCENSION ISLAND - AC (Reserved on request of UPU
#                                             Used as a ccTLD)
# Mar 2008     - Fixed a bug where the country code had a space after it.
#                Many thanks to Alexander Betinski of Canada for reporting it.
# April 2009   - [v5.0.0] Completly new frontent and backend for better
#                performacnce.

#                [Prefixed with "~~" to begin and "~~" to end each line].
#                (See notes in database CSV file for format)
# May 2009     - [v5.2.0] Database lookups will now work even during updates

#                (like AWSTATS). We now include the file in the correct format
#                to be used directly by these applictions.
